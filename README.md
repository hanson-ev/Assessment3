Design:
The overall goal for the website’s design was simplicity – where there is no guessing on the user’s part as to where a piece of information is, or what the page contains. 
Underlined, large headings are used in the Things to Do and History columns/rows to ensure that the user can be drawn to what they wish to read about.
Many bright, clear images are used to add context to and break up the text, making it more visually appealing and easier to read. Plenty of space/padding has been added between sections of the pages for the same reason.
The colour scheme of black, Alice blue and white were chosen to due to being “ocean-like” colours, matching thematically with Stonehaven’s nature as a coastal town, while also providing sufficient colour contrast to make it easier to read.
As Dunnottar Castle is seen as the highlight of Stonehaven for visitors, it made sense to have this as the part of the eye-catching banner. The image was chosen for its bright colours.

Challenges:
Creating a responsive banner that works on all devices has proven a challenge during the design process, and still requires improvement. When viewed on smaller devices, the “Site Navigation” dropdown menu disappears, which is unacceptable, and prevents many mobile users from accessing other pages of the website. It could potentially be improved by adding an icon that appears when the Site Navigation text is too long to appear on smaller devices.
The Things to Do page’s navbar repositions its text to be within the confines of the columns, instead of within the confines of the page, leading to a slightly different navbar design to the rest of the pages. It is speculated that this is due to difference in Bootstrap (Bootstrap 4 vs Bootstrap 5). This requires improvement so that the design is consistent with all pages.
